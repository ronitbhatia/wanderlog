## Customization

### Styling
You can customize the appearance by modifying the `st.set_page_config()` call in `streamlit_app.py`:

```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Your Custom Title",
    page_icon="üéØ",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
```

### Adding Features
The modular structure makes it easy to add new features:
- Add new pages by creating functions and adding them to the sidebar navigation
- Extend the database schema in the `init_db()` function
- Add new UI components using Streamlit widgets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Location not found**: Try using more specific location names (e.g., "Paris, France" instead of just "Paris")

2. **Photos not loading**: Make sure the `uploads/` directory exists and has proper permissions

3. **Database errors**: Delete `wanderlog.db` to reset the database

### Performance Tips

- The app uses SQLite for simplicity, but for production consider PostgreSQL
- Large photo uploads may slow down the app - consider image compression
- The geocoding service has rate limits, so avoid rapid successive requests
